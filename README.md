# The DataOpen: Was East London Revitalized by the Olympics?
A Case Study on the London 2012 Olympicsand its effect on the growth boroughs of London.

## Approach 
we focused on the 6 London growth boroughs, which were targetted by the Olympics organising comittee and attempted to determine if these have been revitalised by hosting the games. The approach we took was to investigate: 
* economy and business
* housing
* dining (restaurants, bars, pubs, takeaway food stands) 
* entertainment (museums) 
* transport

We analysed and contrasted the percent growth of all boroughs in the years from when the bid was placed for the Olympics and during the Olympics.
